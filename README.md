Keypad Passcode Security System
This project implements a passcode-based security system using an embedded system. The system uses a keypad to input a passcode, checks if the entered passcode matches the preset one, and provides feedback through a green or red LED and an LCD display. If the correct passcode is entered, the system allows access by turning on a motor and displaying a success message. If the wrong passcode is entered more than three times, the system blocks further attempts for one minute and displays a warning message on the LCD.

Features
Keypad Input: Enter passcode using a 4x4 matrix keypad.
Motor Control: Motor turns on when the correct passcode is entered.
LED Indicators:
Green LED: Indicates correct passcode and access granted.
Red LED: Indicates incorrect passcode and access denied.
LCD Display: Displays passcode entry status and messages such as "Try Again" or "Blocked for 1 min".
Security Lock: Blocks further attempts for 1 minute after 3 consecutive wrong passcodes.
Components Used
8051 Microcontroller: Main controller for the system.
4x4 Keypad: Used for passcode input.
LCD Display (16x2): Displays messages to the user.
DC Motor: Simulates the access mechanism when the correct passcode is entered.
LEDs:
Green LED: Shows access granted.
Red LED: Shows access denied.
Circuit Diagram
The circuit consists of the following components connected to the 8051 microcontroller:

Keypad connected to specific pins of the microcontroller.
LEDs (green and red) connected to output pins for feedback.
LCD connected to the microcontroller for display output.
A DC motor controlled by the microcontroller to simulate the unlocking mechanism.
System Flow
Enter Passcode: The user enters a passcode using the keypad.
Check Passcode:
If the passcode is correct, the system turns on the motor and the green LED, and displays "Access Granted" on the LCD.
If the passcode is incorrect, the red LED lights up, the motor stays off, and the LCD displays "Try Again".
Lockout: After three failed attempts, the system displays "Blocked for 1 min" on the LCD and prevents further attempts for one minute.
Retry After Lockout: After one minute, the system allows the user to re-enter the passcode.
Requirements
Hardware:
8051 Microcontroller (or compatible).
4x4 Matrix Keypad.
16x2 LCD Display.
DC Motor (for access simulation).
Green and Red LEDs.
Software:
Keil uVision for C programming.
Proteus for circuit simulation.
Code Explanation
Keypad Scanning: The system scans the 4x4 keypad for the entered passcode.
Password Matching: The entered passcode is compared with the preset passcode stored in the code.
Motor Control: If the passcode is correct, the motor is turned on.
LED Feedback: Green LED indicates correct passcode, while the red LED indicates incorrect entry.
LCD Display: Provides feedback on the current status (correct passcode, incorrect entry, lockout).
How to Use
Power on the system.
Enter a passcode using the 4x4 keypad.
Observe the feedback on the LCD and LED:
If correct, the motor turns on, and the LCD displays "Access Granted".
If incorrect, the LCD shows "Try Again", and the red LED lights up.
After three failed attempts, the system will display "Blocked for 1 min" on the LCD and prevent further attempts for one minute.
After one minute, the system will reset, and you can re-enter the passcode.
